## Introduction

This project simulates the inner workings of the German Enigma machine, a historical encryption device used during World War II. The Enigma machine played a crucial role in secure communication for the German military, and its cryptographic mechanisms were considered highly advanced for its time.

This project aims to provide a comprehensive and accurate representation of the Enigma machine's functionality, allowing users to explore and understand the encryption **and** decryption processes employed by this iconic device.

## Getting Started

To run the Enigma simulation, follow these steps:

**1. Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/bad-engineer/enigma.git
```
**2. Compile the project.**

**3. Run the executable and set rotor configurations as prompted.**

**4. Enter the message to encrypt.**

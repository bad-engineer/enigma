## Introduction

This project simulates the inner workings of the German Enigma machine, a historical encryption device used during World War II. The Enigma machine played a crucial role in secure communication for the German military, and its cryptographic mechanisms were considered highly advanced for its time.

This project aims to provide a comprehensive and accurate representation of the Enigma machine's functionality, allowing users to explore and understand the encryption **and** decryption processes employed by this iconic device.

## Getting Started

To run the Enigma simulation, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/bad-engineer/enigma.git

2. Run the program and set rotor configurations as prompted
3. Enter the message to encrypt
4. To decrypt, enter the cipher. Remember to enter the same rotor configuration used for encryption
